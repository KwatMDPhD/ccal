# See big picture

CCAL itself doesn't have much code. Instead, CCAL uses other cool libraries as submodules in `ccal/`, and import their awesome functions inside `ccal/__init__.py`'.

# Install

[Quickly create a shareable project that uses CCAL](https://spro.io/creating_project_from_template/#example). Using shareable project ensures that people who use CCAL have the same base environment - **best practice**.

Or you can manually install CCAL

```sh
pip install ccal
conda install --channel conda-forge rpy2 r-mass
```
